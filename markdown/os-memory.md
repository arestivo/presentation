# Introduction

# Memory


* Memory is not infinite.
* There is a hierarchy:
  * Cache: Volatile, Limited size, Expensive, Temporary use, Very fast...
  * Primary: Volatile, Fast, ...
  * Secondary: Non-volatile, slow, cheap, ...
* The memory management function of the OS creates an abstraction
that simplifies the usage of memory.

# Word Size

* The number of binary digits that a CPU can process at one time.
* In modern computers also the size of the address space.
* For example: a **byte**-addressable **32-bit** computer can address: 2<sup>32</sup> bytes of memory (4GiB).

# Physical Addresses

# Physical Address

* Each physical memory location has an address.
* Physical addresses start at zero.
* Example for a 32-bit computer with 16MiB of memory:

---

# Single Contiguous Allocation

* The simplest memory management technique. 
* All the memory is available to a **single** application.
* With the exception of a small portion reserved for the operating system.
* Examples: MS-DOS, Embedded Systems, ...

---

# Multitasking

* With a single CPU, only one task (process) is said to be running at any point in time. 
* Multitasking solves the problem by scheduling which task is running at any given time.
* Reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a **context switch**.
* Parallelism is achieved when context switches occur frequently enough.

---

# Static Relocation

* In a single contiguous allocation enviroment, the CPU is forced to swap the memory contents every time a context switch occurs.
* A better solution is to allocate a part of the memory to each process.
* Access to the memory is protected using *base* and *limit* registers (hardware protection): base &leq; address < base + limit.

# Address Binding

When code is compiled from a high level language into machine code, the address of variables can be bound to:
* **Absolute** addresses (if we know where a process will be located in memory). 
* **Relocatable** addresses (if we want to be able to have the process in any memory location).

---

# Logical Addresses

Address binding is the process of translating logical addresses into their corresponding physical addresses:

![](../assets/memory/logical.svg)

* Address relocation: physical = logical + base
* Memory protection: base &leq; physical < base + limit

---

# Swapping

Sometimes there is not enough space to keep all processes in memory at the same time.

Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes.

---

# Fragmentation

The problem of having contiguous memory allocation is that as processes are swapped in and out of memory, the memory becomes fragmented:

![](../assets/memory/fragmentation.svg)

Fragmentation can be fixed by using a memory compaction technique.

# Virtual Addresses

# Virtual Memory

Gives the illusion of access to a larger memory space than exists by storing part of the process data into secondary storage.

![](../assets/memory/virtual.svg)

---

# Paging

Most virtual memory systems are implemented using a memory management technique called paging:

.pull-left[
* The process address space is broken into blocks of the same size called pages.
* The main memory is divided into small fixed-sized blocks of memory called frames (usually the same size as a page).
* At any given time, pages can be loaded into memory or stored in secondary storage.
]

]

---

# Advantages

* Simple to implement.

* Paging reduces fragmentation.

* Paging is an efficient memory management technique.

* Due to equal size of the pages and frames, swapping becomes very easy.

---

# Page Tables

* A virtual address is composed by a page number and an offset.
* A physical address is composed by a frame number and an offset.

![](../assets/memory/page-frame.svg)

* From the standpoint of the process, memory is contiguous.
* Page tables are used to translate the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware.
