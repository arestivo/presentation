# Markup Languages

* A **markup language** is a set of words and symbols for describing the
  identity or function of the component parts of a document.
* Programs can use markup with a **stylesheet** to transform the document into
  output for screen, print, audio, video, Braille, or reprocessable data
  formats.

# XML

* E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage (XML) 
* A **markup language** that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a
  format which is both human-readable and machine-readable.
* It is **extensible** because it is not a fixed format like HTML (which is a
  single, predefined markup language).
* XML is a metalanguage which lets you design your own markup languages for 
  limitless different types of documents.

# SGML

* SGML is the **S**tandard **G**eneralized **M**arkup **L**anguage, the
  international standard for defining markup to describe the structure of
  different types of electronic document.
* SGML is very **large**, **powerful**, and **complex**.
* XML is a **lightweight** cut-down version of SGML.
