# Introduction

# Relational Model

* A simple **Database model** based on first-order predicate logic.
* First formulated and proposed in **1969** by Edgar F. **Codd**.
* But still the most used model for databases.
* Other models include *hierarchical* and *network* models.

---

# Principles

* Relational Model:

  * Set of relations: **tables**;
  * Composed by *tuples* (*records*) and *attributes*: **rows** and **columns**.

* Each relation:

  * Has **name**;
  * Contains **attributes**;
  * Subject to **constraints**.

---

# Relation

![](../assets/relationalmodel/relation.png)

---

# Tuples

 * The **lines** of a relation;
 * **Ordered** sequence of values;
 * Tuples do not have a specific order between them;
 * Tuple values are **atomic** (no composite or multi-value).

---

# Notation

| | |
|-|-| 
| R (A1, A2, ..., An) | Relation schema R of degree n |
| Q, R, S | Relation names |
| t, u, v | Tuples |
| t (a1, a2, ..., an) | Tuple $t$ of a relation |
| t[Ai] | The value of the attribute *Ai* in the tuple *t* |
| t[Ai, Aj, Ak] | value of the attributes *Ai, Aj ,Ak* in the tuple *t* |

Example for an employee:

.relational_example[
Employee (id, name, address, telephone)
]

# Constraints

---

# Domain

* The set of **possible** values for a given **attribute**.
* Can be considered a **constraint** on the value of the attribute.
* Examples:

 * integer values;
 * email addresses;
 * any text under 140 characters;
 * true or false.

---

# Not Null Constraint

For certain attributes, **null** can be a possible value. Others don't allow the null value.

Notation for **not null** attributes [NN]:

.relational_example[
Employee (id, name [NN], address, telephone)
]

---

# Key Constraints

* No two tuples can have the same combination of values for
all their attributes;
* **Superkey**: set of attributes in a relation R such that no 2
different tuples will have the same values for that set of
attributes;
* **Key**: minimal set of attributes in relation R such that no 2
tuples have the same values;
* **Candidate key**: any key. 

---

# Primary Key

Key chosen to be used to **identify** tuples in a relation:

* Other candidate keys are **unique** keys;
* Every relation schema **must have** a primary key;
* The attribute values of the primary key **cannot** be *null*.

---

# Table with a Primary Key

![](../assets/relationalmodel/primarykey.png)

---

# Notation

Notation for primary keys (underline):

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>primary key</u>, attribute 1, addattribute 2, ..., attribute n)
]

Example for an employee:

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>id</u>, name [NN], address, telephone)
]

---

# Table with a Double Primary Key

![](../assets/relationalmodel/doubleprimarykey.png)

---

# Unique Keys

 * Unique keys are **similar to primary keys** but **allow null** values.
 * A relation can have **several** unique keys.

---

# Table with an Unique Key

![](../assets/relationalmodel/uniquekey.png)

---

# Notation

Notation for unique keys [UK]:

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>primary</u>, attribute 1 [UK], attribute 2, ..., attribute n)
]

Example for an employee:

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>id</u>, name [NN], address, telephone [UK])
]


---

# Foreign Keys

* An **attribute** (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies a tuple of another, or the same, relation.
* Can be used to **cross-reference** relations.
* Possible to use the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation.

---

## Table with a Foreign Key

![](../assets/relationalmodel/foreignkey.png)

---

## Notation

Notation for foreign keys (# and arrow):

.relational_example[
Relation (<u>primary_key</u>, attribute, #foreign_key &rarr; Referenced Relation)
]


Example for an employee and a department:

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>id</u>, name [NN], telephone [UK], #num &rarr; Department)

Department (<u>num</u>, name [NN])
]

---

# Constraints
## Summary

* **Primary key** values **cannot be null**.
* **Key values** (primary and unique) **cannot have repeated** values.
* **Values** have to belong to the attribute **domain**.
* Attributes with a **not null** constraint **cannot have null** values.
* **Foreign key** attributes can only have values that **exist in the referenced relation**.

# List of Operations

* **Insertion**: Inserts a new tuple into a relation.
* **Deletion**: Deletes one or more tuples from a relation.
* **Update**: Updates one or more tuples.

# UML to Relational

# Class

![](../assets/uml/class.svg)

--

* A relation representing the class;
* Derived attribute can be ommited and calculated when needed;
* If no good candidate key exists, a primary key can be created.

.relational_example[
Person (<u>id</u>, birth_date, name, address, salary)
]

---

# Many-to-one Association (partial)

![](../assets/uml/many-to-one-partial.svg)

--

* Foreign key from the many to the one side;
* Can have null values as employee might not have a department.

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>id</u>, birth_date, name, address, salary, #num &rarr; Department)

Department (<u>num</u>, name)
]

---

# Many-to-one Association (total)

![](../assets/uml/many-to-one-total.svg)

--

* Foreign key from the many to the one side;
* Cannot have null values as employee must have a department.

.relational_example[
Employee (<u>id</u>, bdate, name, address, salary, #num &rarr; Department [NN])

Department (<u>num</u>, name)
]

---

# One-to-one Association (partial)

![](../assets/uml/one-to-one-partial.svg)

--

* Foreign key from the total to the partial side;
* Can have null values as person might not have a passport.
* Unique key as every passport must belong to a different person.

.relational_example[
Person (<u>id</u>, birth_date, name, address, #number &rarr; Passport [UK])

Passport (<u>number</u>, name)
]

---

# One-to-one Association (total)

![](../assets/uml/one-to-one-total.svg)

--

* Foreign key from the many to the one side;
* Cannot have null values as employee must have a department.

.relational_example[
Person (<u>id</u>, birth_date, name, address, #number &rarr; Passport [UK,NN])

Passport (<u>number</u>, name)
]

---

# Many-to-many Association

![](../assets/uml/many-to-many.svg)

--

* A new relation containing foreign keys to both relations;
* Primary key formed by both foreign keys.

.relational_example[
Book (<u>isbn</u>, title, date)

Author (<u>number</u>, name, nationality)

Wrote (<u>#isbn &rarr; Book</u>, <u>#number &rarr; Author</u>)

]

---

# Association Class

![](../assets/uml/association-class.svg)

--

Attributes from the association class go to the same relation as the created foreign keys.

.relational_example[
Student (<u>number</u>, name)

Course (<u>code</u>, name, year)

Enrolled (<u>#number &rarr; Student</u>, <u>#code &rarr; Course</u>, grade)
]
