# Version Control Systems (VCS)

A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time.

![](../assets/git/version-control.svg)

It allows you to:

- **revert** selected files, or a project, back to a previous state
- **compare** changes over time
- see **who modified** something
- ...

AKA Source Control Management (**SCM**)

---

# Local VCS

* Local VCS use a simple database that keeps all changes to files under revision control.
* Most store only the differences between files instead of copies of each version.
* Examples: [RCS](https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/)

![](../assets/git/local-vcs.svg)


---

# Centralized VCS

* A **single server** that contains all the versioned files.
* Computers can **checkout** a particular file version.
* Examples: [CVS](http://cvs.nongnu.org/), [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)

![](../assets/git/centralized-vcs.svg)

---

# Centralized VCS 

Advantages:

* Everyone knows what everyone is doing.
* **Fine grained control** over who can do what.

Disadvantages:

* Single point of **failure**.
* Needs constant **connectivity**.
* Backups are **mandatory**.

---

# Distributed VCS

* All clients **fully mirror** the repository, including its **full history**.
* There is **no difference** between a server and a client.
* But one, or more, computers can be used as a **central point** of synchronization.
* Allows lots of different **workflows**.

![](../assets/git/distributed-vcs.svg)

Examples: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), [Darcs](http://darcs.net/)

# Basics

**Snapshots**:
  * Does not store versions of a file only by their differences. 
  * Instead it saves them as a series of **snapshots**.
  * If files have not changed, it does not store them again (link).

**Local**: Most Git operations are **local**.

**Integrity**: 
  * Everything in Git is *checksummed* (**SHA-1**) before it is stored.
  * Everything is then **referred** to by that **checksum**.
  * Checksum example: <code>7e16b5527c77ea58bac36dddda6f5b444f32e81b</code>

# Snapshots

# Create a Repository

Enter a local directory, currently not under version control:

```bash
cd project
```

And turn it into a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This will create an hidden *.git* subdirectory containing all of your necessary repository files.

---

# Git Sections

The **Git directory** is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.

The **working tree** is a single checkout of one version of the project. 

The **staging area** (or **index**) is a file in your Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.

![](../assets/git/git-sections.svg)

# File States

![](../assets/git/file-states.svg)

---

# Add

The [add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) command can be used to:
  1. Track a file that is currently **not tracked** by Git.
  2. Add a file that has been **modified** to the staging area.

```bash
$ echo "hello git" > README    # File is created
$ git add README               # File is now tracked and staged
```

You can use the **--all** or **-A** flag to stage all untracked **or** modified files.

```bash
$ echo "hello git" > README    # File is created
$ git add --all                # File is now tracked and staged
```

---

# Commit

The [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) command records a new snapshot to the repository:

```bash
$ echo "hello git" > README    # File is created
$ git add README               # File is now tracked and staged
$ git commit                   # Commits the file
```

After running commit, Git will open your [predefined](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) text editor so that you can write a small commit message (or use the **--message** or **-m** flag).

The **--all** or **-a** flag automatically stages any tracked **and** modified files:

```bash
$ echo "goodbye git" > README      # Already tracked file is modified
$ git commit -a -m "Edited README" # Stages and commits the file
```

---

# Status

The [status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command can be used to determine which files are in which state:

```bash
$ echo "hello git" > README    # File is created
$ git status                   # Asking for file status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The **--short** (or **-s**) flag can be used to get a more concise output:

```bash
$ git status --short            # Asking for file status
?? README
$ git add README                # File is now tracked and staged
$ git status --short            # Asking for file status
A  README
```

# Rm

# Log

# Partially Staged Files

A file can be partially staged:

```bash
$ echo "some text" > README    # File is modified
$ git add README               # Modifications are staged
$ echo "another text" > README # File is modified again
```

1) Commiting again would only commit the initial staged edits:

```bash
$ git commit                   # File now still has changes
$ git add README               # Staging those changes
$ git commit                   # File is now unmodified
```

2) Or we could only commit once:

```bash
$ git add README               # Staging the new changes
$ git commit                   # Commiting both changes at once
```
